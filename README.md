# SAT-Segment-and-Track-Anything-for-Microscopy
Integrating segmentation and cell tracking is essential for a detailed and dynamic understanding of cellular behavior. This combination enhances the study and quantification of cell morphology, movement, and interactions, providing valuable insights into various biological processes and diseases. Traditional methods require full masks or bounding boxes for each cell, which is labor-intensive and expensive. To address this, SAT: Segment and Track Anything for Microscopy is presented. This method requires only a few point annotations per cell in the first frame of each sequence and then automatically performs cell segmentation and tracking for all subsequent frames. This approach significantly reduces the time and effort required for annotation, making it more accessible and practical for large-scale studies. The method was evaluated on two diverse datasets, achieving over 80\% Multiple Object Tracking Accuracy (MOTA), demonstrating its robustness and effectiveness in various cell tracking scenarios.
